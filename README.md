Simple Calculator
This Python script is a basic calculator program that allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:
Supports four basic arithmetic operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Handles division by zero by providing an error message instead of crashing the program.
Allows users to perform multiple calculations until they choose to stop.
Functions:
add(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y.
sub(x, y): Returns the difference of x and y.
mul(x, y): Returns the product of x and y.
div(x, y): Returns the result of dividing x by y. If y is zero, an error message is displayed.
simple_calc(): The main function that allows the user to interact with the calculator. It displays a menu for the user to choose the operation and prompts for input values.
How to Use:
Run the script.
The program will prompt you to select an arithmetic operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, and 4 for division).
Enter the two numbers you want to perform the operation on.
The result of the operation will be displayed.
You will then be asked if you want to perform another operation. Type "Yes" to continue or "No" to stop the program.
